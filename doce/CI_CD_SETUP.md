## 🎉 What Was Added

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml`)

Automated CI/CD pipeline that runs on every push and pull request to `main`, `develop`, and `feature/**` branches.

#### Pipeline Structure:

### 2. **Testing Roadmap** (`doce/TESTING_ROADMAP.md`)

Comprehensive testing strategy document with:

#### Current Status:
- **Frontend**: 570 tests, 91.17% statements, **85.51% branches** (need +4.49%)
- **Backend**: 228 tests, 97% instructions, 89% branches

#### Prioritized Improvement Plan:

**Step 1**: MyBookingsPage.vue (63.63% → 85%+ branches)
- Highest priority - biggest coverage gap (26.37%)
- Add 15-18 tests for error handling and edge cases

**Step 2**: ProductPageDetail/[id].vue (73.68% → 88%+ branches)
- High impact - route validation and booking flow
- Add 12-15 tests

**Step 3**: EditEventPage.vue (79.59% → 90%+ branches)
- Medium impact - close to target
- Add 8-10 tests

**Step 4**: MyEventsPage.vue (80.55% → 90%+ branches)
- Final polish - event deletion and filtering
- Add 6-8 tests

#### Testing Best Practices:
- ✅ Target files in 60-80% range (best ROI)
- ✅ Test explicit function calls, not mount behavior
- ✅ Focus on error paths and edge cases
- ✅ Proper mock setup patterns documented
- ❌ Avoid files above 80% (diminishing returns)
- ❌ Avoid complex mount-time behavior testing

#### Mock Setup Examples:
- Correct patterns with module-level mocks
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- useAuth mock configuration
- Timing strategies for async tests

#### Progress Tracking:
- Historical improvements documented
- Coverage by file category
- Success criteria defined
- Execution timeline (4-week plan)

## 🚀 How It Works

### On Every Push/PR:

1. **Frontend Tests Run**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage --reporter=verbose
   ```
   - All 570+ tests execute
   - Coverage calculated
   - If branches < 90%: ❌ Build fails + Issue created
   - If branches ≥ 90%: ✅ Continues

2. **Backend Tests Run**
   ```bash
   mvn -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false clean test jacoco:report
   ```
   - MySQL service starts automatically
   - All 228+ tests execute (including Testcontainers)
   - JaCoCo generates reports
   - If branches < 85%: ❌ Build fails + Issue created
   - If branches ≥ 85%: ✅ Continues

3. **Docker Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   # Health checks
   # API tests
   docker-compose down -v
   ```
   - Full stack builds and starts
   - Services verified healthy
   - Basic integration tests run
   - Clean shutdown

4. **On Failure**
   - GitHub issue auto-created with:
     - Branch and commit info
     - Link to failed workflow run
     - Tagged appropriately
     - @mentions author
   - Coverage reports still uploaded for analysis

5. **On Pull Request**
   - Bot comments with coverage tables
   - Visual status indicators
   - Gap calculations shown

## 📊 Viewing Results

### In GitHub Actions:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/MorningMores/develop
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. See workflow runs for each push/PR

### Coverage Reports:

**Download Artifacts:**
- Go to workflow run
- Scroll to **Artifacts** section
- Download:
  - `frontend-coverage-report` → Open `index.html`
  - `backend-coverage-report` → Open `index.html`
  - `backend-test-results` → View Surefire XML reports

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Frontend
cd main_frontend/concert1
npm test -- --coverage
open coverage/index.html

# Backend
cd main_backend
mvn clean test jacoco:report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Coverage Thresholds:

Edit `.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  FRONTEND_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 90  # Change here
  BACKEND_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 85   # Change here
```

### Trigger on Additional Branches:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, 'feature/**', 'your-branch' ]  # Add here
```

### Change MySQL Version:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0  # Change version here
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Frontend Tests:
- Requires Node.js 20
- Uses npm ci for clean installs
- Coverage reports retained for 30 days
- 3 unhandled errors from MapTestingPage (known issue, doesn't affect tests)

### Backend Tests:
- Requires Java 21
- MySQL service auto-provisioned
- Testcontainers needs Docker daemon
- Tests use `-DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false` for stability

### Docker Integration:
- Requires docker-compose.yml in root
- Builds can take 10-15 minutes
- Health check timeout: 60 seconds
- Automatic cleanup on success or failure

### Issue Auto-Creation:
- Only creates one issue per branch+commit
- Prevents duplicate issues
- Requires `actions/github-script@v7`
- Issues tagged with: `ci-failure`, `automated`, `bug`

## 📈 Next Steps

### 1. Monitor First Workflow Run
```bash
# Push any change to trigger CI
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

Watch: https://github.com/MorningMores/develop/actions

### 2. Improve Coverage (Follow TESTING_ROADMAP.md)

**Week 1**: Work on MyBookingsPage.vue

Settings → Branches → Add rule:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
  - ✅ Frontend Tests & Coverage
  - ✅ Backend Tests & Coverage
  - ✅ Docker Build & Integration Tests
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering?
- Check branch name matches patterns in `on.push.branches`
- Verify workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Check GitHub Actions are enabled: Settings → Actions → Allow all actions

### Frontend Tests Failing?
```bash
# Run locally to debug
cd main_frontend/concert1
npm ci
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Backend Tests Failing?
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Run locally
cd main_backend
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)
mvn clean test
```

### Docker Build Failing?
```bash
# Test locally
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs
docker-compose down -v
```

### Coverage Reports Not Uploading?
- Check artifact upload step didn't fail
- Verify coverage reports generated in expected paths:
  - Frontend: `coverage/`
  - Backend: `target/site/jacoco/`
