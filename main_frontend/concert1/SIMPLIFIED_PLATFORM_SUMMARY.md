# ✅ Simplified Event Platform - Final Summary

## What Changed?

Based on your request: **"join event is same as booking then remove join out and make web feature is functional and work all feature"**

### 🔄 Simplification Complete

Since "Join Event" now creates a booking automatically (same as "Book Tickets"), I've **removed the duplicate "Join Event" functionality** and **kept only the "Book Tickets" button** for a cleaner, more streamlined user experience.
