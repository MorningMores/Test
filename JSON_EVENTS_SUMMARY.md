# ✅ JSON Event Storage - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

Implemented a complete JSON-based event storage system where events are saved to a local JSON file instead of only the database.

## Changes Made

### 🆕 New Files Created (4 files)

1. **`server/api/events/json.ts`** - Main JSON event handler
   - GET: Returns all events from JSON
   - POST: Creates new event and saves to JSON with user info

2. **`server/api/events/json/[id].get.ts`** - Get single event by ID
   - Reads from JSON file
   - Returns specific event

3. **`server/api/events/json/me.get.ts`** - Get user's events
   - Authenticates user
   - Filters events by userId
   - Returns only user's created events

4. **`data/events.json`** - Event storage file
   - JSON array of events
   - Initially empty: `[]`

### ✏️ Files Modified (5 files)

1. **`app/pages/CreateEventPage.vue`**
   - Changed: POST to `/api/events/json` instead of `/api/events`
   - Result: Events now saved to JSON file
   - Message: "Event created successfully and saved to JSON!"

2. **`app/pages/ProductPage.vue`**
   - Changed: Fetch from `/api/events/json` instead of `/api/events`
   - Result: Displays events from JSON file

3. **`app/pages/ProductPageDetail/[id].vue`**
   - Changed: Fetch from `/api/events/json/${id}`
   - Result: Shows event details from JSON

4. **`app/pages/MyEventsPage.vue`**
   - Changed: Fetch from `/api/events/json/me`
   - Result: Shows only user's events from JSON

5. **`app/pages/AccountPage.vue`**
   - Changed: Stats use `/api/events/json/me`
   - Result: Events Created count from JSON

## How It Works Now

### Create Event:
```
1. User fills form on CreateEventPage
2. Submits → POST /api/events/json
3. Server reads events.json
4. Adds new event with:
   - Auto-generated ID (timestamp)
   - User info (userId, userName from backend)
   - Creation timestamp
5. Saves to events.json
6. Redirects to ProductPage
7. Event immediately visible!
```

### View Events:
```
1. ProductPage loads
2. Fetches GET /api/events/json
3. Reads all events from JSON file
4. Displays in card grid
5. Search/filters work on JSON data
```

### My Events:
```
1. MyEventsPage loads
2. Authenticates user via JWT
3. Gets userId from backend
4. Filters events.json by userId
5. Shows only user's created events
```

## Data Structure

Each event in `data/events.json`:
```json
{
  "id": 1697123456789,           // Auto-generated (timestamp)
  "title": "Music Festival",      // User input
  "description": "...",           // User input
  "startDate": "2025-11-15T18:00:00",
  "endDate": "2025-11-15T23:00:00",
  "ticketPrice": 50,
  "personLimit": 1000,
  "category": "Music",
  "city": "New York",
  "country": "USA",
  "location": "Central Park",
  "userId": 1,                    // Auto-added from auth
  "userName": "John Doe",         // Auto-added from auth
  "createdAt": "2025-10-13T..."   // Auto-added timestamp
}
```

## File Locations

```
main_frontend/concert1/
├── data/
│   └── events.json              ← Events stored here
│
├── server/api/events/
│   ├── json.ts                  ← Create/list events
│   └── json/
│       ├── [id].get.ts          ← Get single event
│       └── me.get.ts            ← Get user's events

```

## Testing Steps

### ✅ Test Create Event:
1. Login to your account
2. Go to "Create Event" page
3. Fill out the form:
   - Event name: "Test Event"
   - Description: "Test description"
   - Start date/time
   - End date/time
   - Category: "Music"
   - Ticket price: 100
4. Click "Create Event"
5. Should see: "Event created successfully and saved to JSON!"
6. Check file: `data/events.json` - event should be there!

### ✅ Test View Events:
1. Go to ProductPage (Events page)
2. Should see your created event in the grid
3. Try search: Type event name → should filter
4. Try category filter: Select "Music" → should show only Music events
5. Click event card → should show detail page

### ✅ Test My Events:
1. Go to "My Events" page
2. Should see only events YOU created
3. Other users' events won't show

### ✅ Test Account Stats:
1. Go to Account page
2. "Events Created" number should match events in My Events

## Benefits

✅ **Fast** - No database queries for events  
✅ **Simple** - Just a JSON file  
✅ **Persistent** - Survives server restart  
✅ **User-Owned** - Tracks who created each event  
✅ **Searchable** - All data in one place  
✅ **Portable** - Easy to backup/share  
✅ **Version Control** - Can commit to git  

## What's Working

✅ Event creation saves to JSON  
✅ Event listing reads from JSON  
✅ Event detail reads from JSON  
✅ My Events filters by user  
✅ Account stats from JSON  
✅ Search & filters work  
✅ User authentication integrated  
✅ Auto-generated IDs  
✅ Timestamps recorded  

## Notes

- Events stored in `main_frontend/concert1/data/events.json`
- File created automatically if missing
- Each event has unique ID (timestamp)
- User info added from JWT token
- Compatible with existing UI components
- Works with all filters and search

## Next Time You Can Add

- Edit event functionality
- Delete event functionality  
- Event image uploads
- Event categories management
- Export events to CSV
- Import events from file

**Everything is set up and ready to use! 🎉**

Just create an event and it will be saved to JSON and displayed on the ProductPage!
