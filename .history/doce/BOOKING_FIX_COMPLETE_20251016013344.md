# âœ… Booking Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
The booking system was failing with a **500 error** when users tried to book tickets. The error was: `"Event not found"`.

## Root Cause
The backend was trying to look up events in the **MySQL database** using a foreign key relationship, but events are actually stored in a **JSON file** (`data/events.json`) on the frontend side.

## Solution
Changed the booking system to **store event data directly** in the bookings table instead of using a foreign key relationship to a non-existent events table.
